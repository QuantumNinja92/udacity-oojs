      <h1>Prototype Chains</h1>
      <p>
        A Mechanism to make an object resembles another object.
        for Object "foo" to have object "bar" using the "=" operator, that will result in
        "foo" having what "bar" have now, if you added ".fly()" to "bar" it won't be available in "foo" and will result of failed lookup.
        Prototype Chains will delegate the failed lookup to the original object, in this case "bar".
