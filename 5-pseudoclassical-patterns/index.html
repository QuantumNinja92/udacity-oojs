    <h1>Psuedoclassical Patterns</h1>
    <p>
      when you use "new" keyword while creating an object, the interpreter
       will insert new lines into the class, "this=Object.create(Car.prototype);"
       which will replace "var obj = Object.create(Car.prototype);", you can't write this line yourself, but interpreter can bind things to the "this"
        Also "return this;" to replace "return obj;", it won't replace them for you,
         it is the same logic. so we can remove them. <br>
         This Patterns doesn't add anything new, it is just more convenient Syntax
