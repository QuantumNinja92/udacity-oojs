    <h1>Prototypal Classes</h1>
    <p>
      Default object that comes with every function "prototype", this object is
      no different than any other object in javascript, it just come out of the
      box, so you don't have to do anything special to create it
      and no strange functionality will trigger if you used it.
      But it comes with one unique object called "constructor"
